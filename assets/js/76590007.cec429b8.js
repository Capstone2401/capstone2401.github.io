We chose to leverage AWS Lambda to perform the processing that's needed to get our data in the shape needed for storage. However, there were tradeoffs for this decision. AWS Lambda functions have a limit of 1,000 concurrent invocations, which means that we can only ingest 1,000 new pieces of data at a time. Also, if we neared that limit, the performance of our pipeline would degrade as the service would not be able to handle any additional incoming traffic until a running function finishes its execution. While this is a limitation, with our use case being for small to medium sized companies, AWS Lambda functions seem to be a good choice to handle the anticipated traffic volume."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Once a piece of new data has been processed through the Lambda function, we needed to decide how it would be delivered to Redshift. Ideally, we want something that would allow us to constantly send information without significant delay. For this task, we decided to use Amazon Data Firehose. This infrastructure component is a fully managed data delivery pipeline that enables our infrastructure to move data from the AWS Lambda function to Redshift. Firehose sends the information to an AWS S3 bucket, which acts as an intermediary container for the data before it gets copied over to Redshift."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"One benefit to this is that Firehose batches data. This means that it will wait for a certain threshold to be met (either time or volume of data) and send all of the data together to be stored into S3. From there, the batched data will be copied from S3 into Redshift in one transaction. This means that each piece of new data doesn't have to be inserted into Redshift one record at a time, significantly offsetting the discussed downsides of columnar databases. Another benefit to using these S3 buckets in combination with Firehose is that it allows us to perform retries. If the transaction fails, Firehose will initiate another try after five minutes, and will continue to retry until the data has been successfully copied."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"One big tradeoff to using Firehose is that it has a throughput limit of 2,000 transactions per second. Again, since DataLoaf is intended for small to medium sized applications, we felt that this amount of throughput would be justifiable and doesn\u2019t require us to add more complexity to our infrastructure for unnecessary throughput gains."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The second type of data that we wanted to handle within the applications pipeline was update data. Since this is a fundamentally different type of data, we decided to set up a second path within the pipeline to help facilitate updates. We again needed to consider both the processing and delivery of the data to the database. When considering our processing infrastructure, we decided upon another AWS Lambda function. Just as it was used for the new data path, it allows us to do the repackaging needed to shape the data in the appropriate way for insertion to the database. For delivery, we decided not to add an additional piece of infrastructure and instead write the update directly from the Lambda function. This reduces the overall complexity of the pipeline and allows for updates to happen instantly within the function."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var i=a(6540);const s={},n=i.createContext(s);function o(e){const t=i.useContext(n);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:o(e.components),i.createElement(n.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
